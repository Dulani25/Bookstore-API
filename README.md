# Bookstore-API
 
Designed and implemented a RESTful API to manage books, authors, customers, shopping carts, and orders using JAX-RS (Jersey/RESTEasy). Ensured proper request handling with GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods and implemented error handling with ExceptionMappers. Used Postman for API testing and validation.
